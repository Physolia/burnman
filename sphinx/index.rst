BurnMan: a thermodynamic and geophysics toolkit for the Earth and planetary sciences
====================================================================================

BurnMan is a Python library for computing the thermodynamic and thermoelastic properties
of geological materials from simple mineral endmembers to complex multilayered planetary interiors.

BurnMan is released under the GNU GPL v2 or newer. It relies heavily on numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.
