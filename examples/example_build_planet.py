--------------------

For Earth we have well-constrained one-dimensional density models.  This allows us to
calculate pressure as a funcion of depth.  Furthermore, petrologic data and assumptions
regarding the convective state of the planet allow us to estimate the temperature.

For planets other than Earth we have much less information, and in particular we
know almost nothing about the pressure and temperature in the interior.  Instead, we tend
to have measurements of things like mass, radius, and moment-of-inertia.  We would like
to be able to make a model of the planet's interior that is consistent with those
measurements.

However, there is a difficulty with this.  In order to know the density of the planetary
material, we need to know the pressure and temperature.  In order to know the pressure,
we need to know the gravity profile.  And in order to the the gravity profile, we need
to know the density.  This is a nonlinear problem which requires us to iterate to find
a self-consistent solution.

Here we show an example that does this, using the planet Mercury as motivation.

    a self-consistent solution.

    This example allows the user to define layers of planets of known outer radius and self-
    consistently solve for the density, pressure and gravity profiles. The calculation will
    iterate until the difference between central pressure calculations are less than 1e-5.
    The planet class in BurnMan (../burnman/planet.py) allows users to call multiple
    properties of the model planet after calculations, such as the mass of an individual layer,
    the total mass of the planet and the moment if inertia. See planets.py for information
    on each of the parameters which can be called.
