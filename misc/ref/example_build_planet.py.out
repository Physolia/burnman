Planet earth_like consists of 4 layers: 
 Layer inner core made out of Fe_Dewaele with user-defined temperatures 
 Layer outer core made out of Liquid_Fe_Anderson with user-defined temperatures 
 Layer lower_mantle made out of Mg_Perovskite with adiabat temperatures 
 Layer upper_mantle made out of Forsterite with adiabat temperatures
