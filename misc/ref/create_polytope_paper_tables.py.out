Table 11: Independent endmember site-occupancy matrix Eind for a 
six-site clinoamphibole solution model (Green et al., 2016) including full order-disorder.

The published model has 11 independent endmembers, but the site solution space allows for 12.
One potential set of independent endmembers using the partial set as a starting point is as follows:

The last endmember has the following formula (only mixing sites shown):
['[v][Fe]3[Ti]2[Fe]2[Al]4[OH]2']
The following endmember is also missing, and is the one used to complete the basis in the paper:
['[v][Fe]3[Al]2[Fe]2[Si]4[O]2']
(All the missing endmembers can be printed by setting the print_missing_endmembers variable to True)
